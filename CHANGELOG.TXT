~ Fixed bug in solver::trim_regions (infinite loop)
~ Added check for past-the-end iterator in solver::add_region
~ added region::order_preserve_merge_to for const modification (made min/max mutable)
~ modified remove_safe/bomb_from_all_regions to work with set
~ changed add_region to return a pair with bool as second to indicate if anything changed
~ combined find_aux_region and lazy_aux_region with bool input to differentiate (only 1 line difference between the two)
~ fixed bug in *_aux_regions where all regions were tested each time, not just recently modified
