~   fixed grid::open__ by making it non-recursive (preventing stackoverflow)
~   make grid::_grid and _visgrid use cell rather than char
~   changed debug dummy couts use std::ostream with paremeter 0 rather than superset
    (because old version would not work with clang)
~   stored compiler in a variable in makefile
