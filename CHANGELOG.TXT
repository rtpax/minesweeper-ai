~   changed grid::open (and open__ and init) to return an unordered_set of 
    all cells changed, rather than just the number changed.
~   added grid::unopened_cells member to keep track of unopened cells and
    added grid::flag_count to keep track of flagged cells and
    grid::count_unopened() to access the number of cells left
~   added grid_error for exceptions with grid, used in open and open__ to replace
    negative return type for error 
~   changed solver::find_based_region to only add base regions around cells 
    that are newly been opened.
~   changed grid_test to reflect changes
~   removed unused function solver::trim_regions
~   added solver::modified_cells (unordered_set of rc_coord) to keep track of which
    cells find_base_regions should open. Adds cells from apply open, removes all cells
    after find_base_regions
~   changed apply_open so rather than looping through all cells to check which opened,
    it just used the unordered_set returned from grid::open
