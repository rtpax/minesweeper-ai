~   Implemented autodependency in make and made all build version be built by "all"
~   Changed all instances of `addcell` to `add_cell` to make naming more consistent
~   moved test.cpp out to base folder to simplify build
~   Got the tests succesfully compiling
~   fixed bug in grid_test (assumed `get`ing hidden bombs would get bombs)
~   added ostream operator<< for rc_coord and region
