~   reset max cells before remaining to 10 (had changed to 20, but memory costs too great)
~   fixed bug where permutations were calculated incorrectly in expected payout 
    [had n!/(n-k)! instead of n!/((n-k)!*k!)]
~   improved permuation calculation by removing safe and bomb cells around the cell in question
~   changed probability calculation to average the probabilities from the smallest regions
    that contained the cell. Rational being that the smallest cells are the most likely to be relevant
~   changed region::set_count and set_range to throw on bad input rather than return a flag
