~   Removed cout from solver.cpp (to debug2_printf)
~   implemented region_set, implemented with subset_type using set
~   replaced rc_coord{0xffff,0xffff} with more generic BAD_RC_COORD
~   changed ms::solver to use region_set
~   changed bug_print-ing to use debug_printf when DEBUG == 1 and debug2_printf when DEBUG == 2
~   added basic probability checking in solver::step
