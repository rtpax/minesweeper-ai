~   Fixed autodependency target names for *.debug.o and test/test.o (and returned test to original spot at ./test/test.cpp)
~   Removed obsolete trim and assert methods in ms::region
~   fixed bug in region_test.h (set count on same region twice, rather than each once)
~   added -Wall flag
~   fixed bug in solver step (abs instead of fabs for floating, caused bad truncation)
~   removed spingrid and spinoff (finally)
