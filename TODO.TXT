FEATURES

PRIORITY: HIGH
****create algorithm for determining how likely a given cell is to a bomb
~   create algorithm for determining how much payout a given cell is likely to have
~   create algorithm for combining those two likelyhoods to make decisions
****add autodepency to make files (and get rid of my ad hoc header dependency method)


PRIORITY: MEDIUM
****when running make, create release, debug, and tests all in one go.
~   decide how much of the license text to add to each file and do that
~   increase speed! bottleneck is in lazy_aux_regions, was only so slow after adding the
    "remaining" region in solver::find_base_regions. I want that info though, so focus
    on other optimizations
****along the speed vein... create a recently modified region set so that each time
    find_aux_regions is started we don't have to check everything
~   carry over likelyhood data to next iteration or make it really fast to calculate
****pull out regions and kell_keys (and possibly the queues) into a seperate container
    class to seperate the logic

PRIORITY: LOW
~   use computer vision software to play on an actual minesweeper board
~   mark all bombs as flag after winning, rather than leaving hidden (implemented by solver, not grid)

BUGS

PRIORITY: HIGH
~   find SEGFAULT source (all i know is something to do with the std::set in region, 
    I think upon attempting to copy a bad one)
    Date: approx 8/16/2018
~   find floating point exception source (divide by zero). Sometimes happens as late
    as after printing the complete board, often earlier
    Date: approx 8/10/2018
~   Solver attempted to open last hidden cell which it should have known was bomb.
    Either it flagged something incorrectly, or counted incorrectly, or black magic.
    Note: it has always happend at (0,0) when it happens, and the gamestate is LOST.
    based on debug output it seems to go to random selection after being unable to find 
    guarantees.

~   Regions min and max are incorrect after unite/intersect/subtract.
    See test output

PRIORITY: MEDIUM
~   Program does not exit on Ctrl-C (it used to, no new libraries linked)
    Date: 8/21/2018

PRIORITY: LOW
~   Program can freeze computer by consuming too much memory on large boards/overly
    hungry algorithms. Prefer to give up early instead of this
